ATM Plugin

By Nerzox

This plugin is used to recover money depending on the time involved. (You must be connected for at least 2 minutes / have used your ATM for more than 2 minutes). The ATM resets when the player who owns the ATM disconnects. I also implemented the 408 protocol (part of code developed by Virvolta).
